# Classification using Keras and Tensorflow 2
<li>Using Keras and Tensorflow 2.X for classifying cancer </li>
<li>The code is written in python3 </li>
<li>Either run the .ipynb file for step by step visualisation or directly run the python file</li>
<li>Make sure the code files are in the same directory as the dataset cancer.csv  </li>
<li> run the file by typing     

      python3 run.py      
<li>Information will be displayed regarding the number of Epochs while training </li>
<li>Results -> accuracy = 99.45%
    Accuracy is a good metric here to evaluate model as split between the two classes is nearly even </li>
<li> Input layer consist of 9 neurons, followed by next layer consisting of 15 neurons, which is then followed by 7 neurons and then finally an output layer having a single neuron</li>
